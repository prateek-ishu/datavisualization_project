           Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. 
      By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
      Data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information. The practice can also help businesses identify which factors affect customer behavior; pinpoint areas that need to be improved or need more attention; make data more memorable for stakeholders;
       understand when and where to place specific products; and predict sales volumes.</p>

        <p>Visualizing information about nature usually leads to a beautiful solution. This visualization about how and where bioluminescence is present on the Southeastern coast of Australia is a great example.

            Where the Wild Things Grow is a Tableau visualization created for National Geographic by Jonni Walker. The bioluminescence is visualized as shiny shapes over a satellite image of the area. The legend and the information are organized around the map and are very easy to read.</p>
